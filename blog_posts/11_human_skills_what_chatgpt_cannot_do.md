Let's assume for now 'human skills' can be defined as everything ChatGPT (and AI more broadly) cannot do. We can take this thought experiment to add to the conversation of what should be taught in school.

Naval in a podcast briefly describees the current capabilties of the LLM models to include:

- Language translation. (The recent breakfthrough via the new architecture actually came from the team at Google Translate). See seminal article for the background story [The Great AI Awakening](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/magazine/the-great-ai-awakening.html)
- Low level coding. Another set of languages, but build from the ground up on logic - it's no surprise that the LLMs have made massive strides in reading and writing code. This website was created in an hour or so using ChatGPT to write the code.
- Image and video generation.
- Synthesizing, analysing, redacting reports.

To sum up the above - AI replaces intellectual drudgery.

So what are human skills? Solving problems we don't yet know how to solve.
