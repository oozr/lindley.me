Recently I cam accross the concept of 'Learning Velocity'. This is both something I don't think has been discussed enough and perhaps now is the time to discuss it based on recent progress made in analytics and AI.

Schooling is mostly about - did they learn the knowledge or not? And it hasn't been to do with how quickly did they learn? More and more, speed of learning will play a role in this world than simply just learning. Why is this? Because the world is moving quickly, and we have to learn, unlearn, and relearn all the time. 

### How can we measure learning velocity?
As the oft-repeated addage goes, 'What we can't measure we can't manage'. And traditionally we have shied away from measuring learner velocity. In fact the only measurement of learning that's taken place in the past is through formal assessment. I will argue we have to move away from regular assessment, to always-on assessment. Assessment is just a toggle you turn on as you work your way through learning.
