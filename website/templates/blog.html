              <h2>About the GSE and CEFR</h2>
              <p class="text-muted">Posted on January 2, 2021 by John Smith</p>
              <p class="card-text">The CEFR and the GSE are two essential tools for measuring and assessing language proficiency. They provide a standardized way of evaluating language skills, enabling learners to track their progress and set goals for improvement.</p>
              <p class="card-text">The CEFR is a framework that describes language ability on a scale from A1 (beginner) to C2 (proficient), based on a set of descriptors for each level. It is used widely in Europe and beyond and is recognized by employers and educational institutions worldwide.</p>
              <p class="card-text">The GSE is a similar framework that measures English language proficiency on a scale of 10-90, with 10 being beginner level and 90 being expert level. It is aligned with the CEFR and provides a detailed breakdown of language skills across various domains, such as reading, writing, speaking, and listening.</p>
              <p class="card-text">Proficiency in languages is increasingly important in today's global economy. But how proficient do you need to be for your individual job role? The ability to communicate effectively with colleagues, clients, and customers from different countries and cultures can provide a significant competitive advantage. Therefore, it is essential to recognize the importance of frameworks such as the CEFR and the GSE and to work towards developing our language skills to meet the demands of a rapidly changing world.</p>
