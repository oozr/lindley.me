Title: Iceland.AI: Converting film images to motion

Here's an artistic project I've started, and hope to continue as AI technology develops:

**Take an image captured on a film camera and convert it to a motion picture using AI technology**

### The Process
Quite simple, take a picture using a film camera. Scan in the negative/image and then use commercially available AI software to convert the picture into a motion picture; adding depth/movement. 

As an added tip, using expired film can get a more grainy/light flared/color washed image which will be important going forward.

### The Reason
Art is in the result, but also in the process. We're combinging 20th century and 21st century technologies: the film camera, and AI computer technology. There's a few reasons why we should do this: 

1. Digital photography/videography is almost perfect, as is the production of images by AI alone. There is a loss of imperfection. The way to connect to your audience isn't via perfect representation of images behind ideas, but through communication of ideas behind images. To do so we have to recognise the imperfections of the mind, the imperfect memory of places, what time and experience does to those images stored in the brain and how they come to life in our dreams. Bring in (back) film photography.

2. But film photography isn't enough. Now we can add motion to film photography, add a few seconds to the memory and give the viewer just a few more clues about the idea: DEPTH. The results are stunning, and I'm sharing my film photography from 2004 taken in Iceland below. I can't wait till the waterfalls start moving, and the camera spans round the landscape even more - without bringing back perfection to the image. I can't wait for you to see what I remember (and not what I saw). 

### Concluding Thoughts
Artists are in the business of communicating memories, ideas, feelings, emotions and dreams, via stories and new techniques. We are not in the business in communicating 'what is', as the loss of human interpretation to places, events and history will be a great loss to humanity.

The world is about to become rich with ways of bringing memories to life. What we looked at today is primitive. Other methods we can use is using LLMs to injest diaries that we kept, summarise and pull out key points of hours of voice recordings and synthesize voices of lost loved ones. This is where we start. The future is limitless - but if there is one thing you should take away from this post is, the end result doesn't need to be perfect, and the more imperfect the prompt (film photography) sometimes the richer the memory.
