Conclusion first so you know my opinion from the get go. I like using Chat-GPT for learning, I use it everyday in a variety of ways. This post isn't about 'hallucinations', I take it for granted that you know Chat-GPT isn't always accurate. 

## Using AI as a Tutor

### Ask Questions that you didn't understand from another Source



## Beware of Forgetfullness! 

Learning is learning how to learn, sure. But it's also memory. And without going into more detail of learning science I will assume that you believe a certain degree of memorising what you learnt - facts and theories is important. One of the biggest drawbacs of using Chat-GPT to learn is that it's easy to fall into the trap of being told the right answer - and then forgetting it. Yes one of the benefits of books, is that they make learning difficult! And in making it difficult they force you to lift some brain weights and memorise the lessons. 

Here are some tips to aid memory recall:

### Summarise your Conversation

### Ask AI to Ask You 5-10 Open-Ended Questions

### New Topic, New Chat.
