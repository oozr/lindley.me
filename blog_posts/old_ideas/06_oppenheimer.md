Watch the film, if you haven't then don't read on.

It's good, sure, but you all knew that. Well done Christopher, but here's what I want:

Reshoot, into two parts. Yes, this film should be a biopic, each part as epic as the other.

### Oppenheimer Part 1: The Bomb
Cool no? Loved the chain reactions accross the cities and his chats with Einstein. Give me more science, don't just tell me 'it's complicated'. And give me more scale of the bomb and it's impact on the world. Give me more visuals and try a bit harder with the rendering of the blast. We can reference Oppenheimer's confliting emotions, but this will be more triumphant than the hurt, pain, McCarthy-esque accusition of part 2. 

### Oppenheimer Part 1: The Man
Before and after. Here you have more space to explore Oppenheimer's ambivalence towards the bomb, his dualist feelings and his lack of conviction. The man is getting accused of siding with the Soviet Union whereas really he's feeling guilty of killing Japanese. What's the difference when the pain is real? Rumbumptiously existential. It was there in the film, but I thought this could be brought out more.


Why would this be so good? Well there are so many questions I'd like to be explored further:

- How did the fundamental discoveries of modern day physics lead to the most destructive force the world has ever seen? Is there any poetry in all of this?
- How much did the world change with one invention? It's not a long stretch to draw parrellels to today's society where the recent advances in AI could be a seond turning point.
- What did Oppenheimer acutally believe? Or was the fact that he flirted with many theories a mark of a true scientist? Does it even matter?
- Why do we turn to physicists in times of dire need. Are these physicists purely good for giving us tools or should they be the tool wielders i.e. the politicians? 


So yes the film was good, but my critique would be it's a lot to pack in to one film, and the conflicting emotions throughout the whole film would be better explored in two separate films.
