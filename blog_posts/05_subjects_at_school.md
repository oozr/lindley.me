Title: Subjects I Wish we Studied at School

It's very easy to criticise national curriculums, teachers and knowledge that is deemed 'worth knowable', 10-15 years from today when we graduate. Part the problem is poltical view points, part is how fast pace scientific discovery is changing 'facts' and 'theories', but the main part is not knowing what skills and knowledge will be needed by the time a 5 year old is 20 and enters into the productive cycle of their life. 

&nbsp;

The following subjects are a result of all three of these issues, it's personal and very open to criticism. My hope is not to change curriculums, but to encourage you dear reader to think what areas of life are you delusional about, what areas of life you should know more about; basically to structure your continued learning.

&nbsp;

### 1. Money
Perhaps the most important topic that we all must deal with, no not trigonometry, not cosign waves, not chemical transformation, but money. Moolah, bunse, dollar. My feeling why this topic isn't included in the curriculum is for the most pessimistic of reasons, such is the glaring absence of this subject; not everyone wants us to learn. Some of the lessons I wish I had earlier; economic causes of the World Wars, asset vs a liability, inflation, compound interest, gold standard, the cycle of currencies etc. 

&nbsp;

### 2. Big History
Ask anyone in the street, your average citizen, how old is the earth, how long humans have been around, how big is the universe (how old is the universe) and I am sure 99% won't be able to answer. This is the most perplexing failure of education I can think of, that we don't know the answers to these basic questions, but science does. What can we do with the answers? How will this impact the working population? Developing a sense of perspective, and if that isn't what education is about then I don't know what it is.

### 3. Intelligence
Linked to many of the other subjects here, intelligence would be about who we are, what is our place, where did we come from, who else and what else displays intelligence. Of course a big part of this would be the development of artifical intelligence.

&nbsp;

### 4. Communication 
Perhaps the most tangible of all these subjects to real world use - communication skills. Giving presentations, writing emails, Instagram and Tweets. I feel that the American system excels at producing graduates with fantastic communication skills - speaking, whereas the English system promotes knowledge, understanding, deep thinking (so writing), but not social skills.

&nbsp;

### 5. World Views
A mixture of philosphy and comparative religious studies. A key text that has been transformational on my adult education is 'Sophie's World', where we learn that all philosophies and religions are primitive stabs and trying to figure out who are are, why we are and where we belong. Here we are trying to answer the big questions, and even more fundamentally, encouraging the asking of big questions. Encouraging curiosity, open-mindedness, acceptance and the idea of truths.

### 6. Logic 
I was going to say computer science, but I think logic can encompass that.

### 7. Spirituality
