    <h1>Global Scale of Languages</h1>
    <p>This website builds on the work done by the Global Scale of English (GSE) and the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). We are not affiliated with either, but seek ways to apply the tools and promote their utility.</p>
    <p>The GSE analyser is the most advanced text analyser on the internet. This is the only one which will give you an exact GSE score (10-90), taking into account sentence complexity and the GSE vocabulary scores.</p>
    <p>The CEFR analyser takes into account language fluctuations, including in Arabic, German, Italian and Spanish. Each analysis draws on academic research done into the unique aspects of each of the languages.</p>
    <p>For more information on the GSE, the CEFR, and the formulas used in the analysers, head over to the blog.</p>
